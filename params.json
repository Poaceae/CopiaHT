For sequences in loblolly pine, sugar pine and Norway spruce genome, blast search was performed locally by BLAST+2.2.30. Sequences in Repbase were also retrieved through local blast. Representative sequences of each species (percent of identity of each other<90% ) were selected for making alignment and phylogenetic tree. A threshold as e value< e-20 and percent identity>75% was set for local blast search.\r\n\r\nPtRLC_724_B protein sequences were obtained through the tblastn results against the DNA sequences using Co4_Po_tr protein sequence in Repbase as the query.\r\n\r\nBoth DNA and protein sequences alignments were by MUSCLE  with default settings.\r\n\r\n## Phylogenetic tree construction\r\nConserved sites for phylogenetic analyses were  selected based on the alignments by Gblocks0.91b under less stringent criteria “allow smaller final blocks” and “allow less strict flanking positions”. A total of 2995  nucleotide sites were kept after selection.\r\n\r\nSubstitution models for nucleotide sequences and amino acid sequences were selected using jModelTest2 and ProtTest 2.4, respectively.  jModelTest2 was ran on the CIPRES server (https://www.phylo.org/ ).  Models were evaluated under all four criterions: AIC, BIC, AICc and LnL. The model listed as the best fit under most criterions was selected for phylogenetic tree construction. For PtRLC_724_B homologous sequences, the best nucleotide substitution model was GTR+G+F, and the best amino acid substitution model was JTT+G+F. \r\n\r\nMaximum likelihood trees were built using the PhyML 3.0 program available on the ATGC bioinformatics platform (http://atgc.lirmm.fr/phyml/ ), selecting options according to the best fitting substitution model. For trees based on DNA sequences, the number of substitution rate categories was set as 6 (to be consistent with that used in Bayesian tree). Both SPR and NNI were used for tree improvement. aLRT SH-like method was applied for branch support. One hundred  bootstrap iterations were also performed. \r\n\r\nBayesian trees were built with MrBayes3.2.6 on CIPRES (https://www.phylo.org/ ). 5,000,000 generations MCMC were run and sampled every 100 generations; other options were selected according to the best fitting substitution model.\r\n","google":"UA-70948222-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
